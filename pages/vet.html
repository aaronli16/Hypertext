  <h1>Earth-1124: The Vet</h1>
  <p>Not every hero wears a cape. On Earth-1124, Aaron Li wears scrubs — and a stethoscope.</p>

  <p>From a young age, he was inseparable from his two labadors: Travis and Isabelle. They were his best friends, his adventure partners, his therapy through chaos. Until life hit — hard.</p>

  <p>Max was lost in a car accident. Luna passed a year later after a battle with cancer. Aaron was there through it all — helpless, heartbroken, and angry at how little he could do.</p>

  <p>That was the moment everything changed.</p>

  <p>He made a silent promise: No one should have to lose their best friend too soon.</p>

  <p>Aaron became a veterinarian. Not for prestige. Not for profit. But for purpose. He worked in shelters, clinics, mobile vans — wherever the need was greatest. His specialty? Critical cases. Lost causes. Dogs others gave up on.</p>

  <p>He saved lives. Not just dogs — families. Every tail wag he brought back meant a kid smiled again, a lonely elder felt loved again, a home became whole again.</p>

  <p>And he never stopped. He started a network of affordable animal clinics. He created a foundation to fund cancer treatments for pets. He gave humans more time with the creatures that loved them most.</p>

  <p>In this universe, Aaron Li doesn’t build tech or perform on stages. He heals. He listens. He cares. And that, too, is a kind of superpower.</p>
