  <h1>Earth-214: The Relentless</h1>
  <p>Aaron Li was born in water. A swimmer before he could walk, his life revolved around lanes, laps, and the endless echo of a poolside whistle. On Earth-214, he rose quickly — from neighborhood meets to national podiums, driven by precision and pure instinct.</p>

  <p>But the flame dimmed. The sport became routine, the joy faded, and eventually, he stepped away. Until one night, he watched Michael Phelps dive into the pool one last time. In that moment, the fire reignited.</p>

  <p>Aaron returned with vengeance — training harder than ever before. He earned a spot at Stanford, dominating collegiate swim meets, and was bound for the Olympic stage. Destiny seemed certain.</p>

  <p>Then came the injury.</p>

  <p>Just months before the Games, a torn rotator cuff shattered the dream. While others mourned his fall, Aaron saw a new lane open — one built on grit.</p>

  <p>He trained. In silence. In pain. Through rain and isolation. Four more years. No shortcuts.</p>

  <p>In his comeback, he didn’t just qualify — he conquered. Aaron Li shattered world records in the 100m and 200m freestyle. The crowd didn’t cheer. They roared. He wasn’t just back. He was unstoppable.</p>

  <p>On Earth-214, Aaron Li is known not for talent — but for tenacity. A symbol of resilience. A reminder that even when fate pulls you under, some heroes still rise.</p>
