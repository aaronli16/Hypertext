  <h1>Earth-815: The Ethical Technologist</h1>
  <p>From the moment Aaron Li typed his first line of code, the world began to change. On Earth-815, he was a prodigy — a digital native raised with a deep reverence for the natural world. Forest hikes fueled his thoughts. Ocean sounds synced with his breathing. He wasn’t just building apps — he was building understanding.</p>

  <p>As artificial intelligence surged ahead, Aaron marveled at its potential. It could solve crises, cure diseases, and rewrite how humanity lived. But the more he learned, the more he uncovered a silent villain: environmental destruction.</p>

  <p>Massive data centers — the backbone of modern AI — were devouring electricity, releasing emissions, and draining the planet. Most ignored it. Aaron couldn’t.</p>

  <p>So he did what heroes do: he built his own path.</p>

  <p>With a startup born in a garage and powered by purpose, Aaron fused his love for code and nature. His company pioneered eco-optimized server routing, water-cooled quantum chips, and real-time AI emissions monitoring.</p>

  <p>He was called idealistic. Delusional. Naive.</p>

  <p>Until he wasn’t.</p>

  <p>Within a decade, Aaron’s innovations had cut global data center emissions by 30%. His net worth passed ten figures — but he didn’t stop. He reinvested into sustainability education, launched green cloud networks, and created the world’s first carbon-negative AI framework.</p>

  <p>The world didn’t just get smarter. It got cleaner. Safer. More sustainable. Because one coder chose to care.</p>

  <p>On Earth-815, Aaron Li is more than a technologist. He’s a guardian of balance. A builder of futures.</p>
