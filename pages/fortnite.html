  <h1>Earth-81: The Builder</h1>
  <p>On Earth-81, the battlefield wasn't made of dirt or steel — it was digital. And Aaron Li? He was born to build.</p>

  <p>It all started in middle school. A friend introduced him to a new game taking over the internet: Fortnite. The colors were wild. The movement was addictive. The storm was always coming. Aaron was instantly hooked.</p>

  <p>He played nonstop — night after night — grinding builds, edits, and eliminations. His parents weren’t thrilled. The grades dipped. The hours added up. One day, they unplugged his dream. The PC was gone.</p>

  <p>But heroes don’t quit. They adapt.</p>

  <p>Aaron picked up odd jobs, saved every dollar, and built a new rig from scratch. He entered his first online tournament. He didn’t just place — he earned money. Real money.</p>

  <p>He showed the receipts to his parents. Their eyes widened. It wasn’t just a phase. It was potential.</p>

  <p>Years passed. His name lit up leaderboards. Streamers started copying his techniques. Commentators called him “The Builder.” He wasn’t just fast — he was calculated. Precise. Philosophical. Every wall, every ramp had intention.</p>

  <p>Then it happened. A clean 1v3 clutch on the world stage. Victory Royale. The crowd erupted.</p>

  <p>Aaron Li became the best Fortnite player on the planet — a legend in pixels and purpose. In the end, he didn’t just build structures. He built belief. In himself. And in an entirely new future.</p>
